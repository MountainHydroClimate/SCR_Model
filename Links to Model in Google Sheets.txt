This Snow Cover Runoff (SCR) model uses monthly calculations of snow cover
frequency (SCF) from the Modis instrument along with previous monthly streamflow to predict
monthly streamflow with a one month lead time.
 
This code requires only Google Sheets with the Solver Add-on activated.

The SCR model is based upon the paper:
Sproles, E.A., Kerr, T., Orrego Nelson, C. Water Resources Management
(2016) 30: 2581. doi:10.1007/s11269-016-1271-4

SCF is calculated using Google Earth Engine,
and the code can be found on this same github site. 

This sample code is set up to run for the La Laguna sub-watershed of the r?o Elqui
in northern central Chile. The model has also been tested on the John Day
(easten Oregon, USA) and the r?o Aragon in northern Spain.
